    <h2>Official Info on Ukraine</h2>
    
   <p>Ukraine was first populated by nomadic tribes such as the Cimmerians, Scythians, and the Goths. Both Greece and Rome established cities in the Ukraine when at the peak of their empires.</p>
   <p>In the 10th century, the Kievan Rus emerged as a growing city-state based out of the city of Kiev. By the 11th century the Kieven Rus was the largest empire in Europe. With the rule of Vladimir the Great in 980, the Kievan Rus became a Christian empire and reached its peak under the rule of his son, Yaroslav the Wise. In the 12th century the empire began to decline and in the 13th century Mongol raiders destroyed the city of Kiev.
   <p>In later years, the Ukraine would become part of other countries, first Poland and later Russia. The Ukrainians made efforts to keep their culture alive despite limits imposed on them by Russia. Russia even banned the use and study of the Ukrainian language. When the Soviet Union took over, things became even worse. Joseph Stalin created an artificial famine to maintain control of the area which killed millions of people. World War II did not make things better for the Ukraine. It is estimated that the German Nazi's killed 1 million Ukrainian Jewish people.
   <p>Yet another disaster struck the Ukraine in 1986 when the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded. The Soviet Union tried to hide the disaster and refused international help. Finally, the Soviet Union collapsed and Ukraine became an independent country in 1991.</p>
